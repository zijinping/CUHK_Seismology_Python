The Multiprocessing Sliding-window Cross Correlation method makes sufficient use of computational power in viewing of large dataset.

Preparation:
    -- arrival time files 'af_folder'
        - File title format: {sta}_{pha}.arr 
            {sta} indicates station name
            {pha} "P" or "S"
        - File content format: {path} {arrival time} 1
            {path} for the sac files. 
                Designate one component (e.g. z) is enough and the program will read in other two component automatically in 3-channel computation
                The event folder name should be in format"YYYYmmddHHMMSSSS",where SSSS indicates seconds. E.g. "1001" indicates 10.01s                         
                The kzdate and kztime for sac files shoulld be set the eeeeeeeevent origin time

    -- out.sum files. The file generated by the hyperinverse. In this sample code, events were cut taking the output origin from by yperinverse. During the program running, it will collect event longitude and latitude information from this file.

Output:
    -- {sta}_{pha}.{segment ID}.xc file. The user could sum up the results into one file.

Usage: python mp_scc.py --af_folder arr_files/
                        --P_scc 'scc -C0.6 -M3 -W-0.5/1/0.75'
                        --S_scc 'scc -C0.6 -M3 -W-1/3/2'
                        --cpu_cores 2
                        --sum_file out.sum
