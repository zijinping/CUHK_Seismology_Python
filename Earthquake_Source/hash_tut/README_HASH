Hash is a program to compute the DC solution from the inversion of the P-wave
first motion data. 

Here we have some read data from the Hong Kong Observatory and the Earthquake
Administration of Guangdong Province, CEA of the recent earthquakes (early 2020)
occured near the Lantau Island. The waveform data is stored under the DATA
directory and in SAC format. 

Some useful scripts are also provided the bin directory. The usage of the
script can refer to the tutorial ppt and the scirpts' comments. 

In this tutorial, we would try to determine the first motion polarity from the
read data and try to do the inversion via HASH. Detailed instructions are listed
in the tutorial ppt. ( https://bit.ly/3axFnV8 )

COMPILATION & RUN THE CODE

    To compile, 
        type `make hash_driverX` where "X" is the example number 1-5

    To run, 
        type `hash_driverX` to run interactively, 
        or type `hash_driverX < exampleX.inp` to run using the given control
        file.

EXAMPLES in HASH

    The essential files and parameters to run the examples are included in exampleX.inp

    Example 1
        Compute DC by azimuth and takeoff angle of each stations with estimated
        uncertainties of both of these angels.

    Example 2
        Plausible velocity models to calculate takeoff angles using 1D ray-
        tracing routine. Each trial uses different combination of velocity 
        model and pretured soure depth to compute sets of takoff angles.

    Example 3
        S/P amplitdue ratios used to compute DC.

    Example 4
        Updated with recent SCEDEC formates, which includes 5-charater 
        stations name.

    Example 5
        Uses output from the program SIMULPS to get azimuth and take-off angles
        for ray tracing in 3D velocity model.
